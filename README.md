# Todo app
## The app
This is a basic to-do app that lets the user add, edit or delete items from the list. The items can be toggled done/not done, and the done items can be toggled as shown or hidden. 

## Tech stack
The app is built with React and with Redux to manage the state. The state is also saved in local storage, so the list persists between uses.
